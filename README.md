### Autonomous Multiagent
We consider a 5x10 gridworld, as shown in Fig 1. Agents start at a fixed location and have four actions (move in each of the four directions). There are two targets available for agents to capture (T1 or T2). T1 and T2 start in fixed positions in the environment, as indicated in Figure 1, and remain fixed (they do not move). Agents receive a reward of 20 for capturing either target. In addition, there is reward of -1 for every time step an agent is in this gridworld without capturing a target.
